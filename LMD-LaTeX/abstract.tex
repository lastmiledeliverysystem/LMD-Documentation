    \textbf{ABSTRACT}
    \end{center}
\hspace{2cm} In this project we propose a fully autonomous robotic system for last-mile delivery application.\\
     The proposed system is supposed to perform two main functions:
     \begin{itemize}
         \item The first function is connecting clients purchasing different objects with the vendors supplying these objects in a certain area.
         \item The second function is transferring purchased objects to their final destinations.
         
     \end{itemize}{}
     
     To achieve these function, our robotic system consists of two main parts:
     \begin{itemize}
         \item The first part is an army of self-driving robots that transport the requested objects to their destinations.
         \item The second part is a web application enabling communication between different stakeholders of the delivery process including vendors and purchasers
     \end{itemize}{}
     The web application is also responsible for coordinating the delivery robots and scheduling their work.We aim to make our self-driving robot capable of safely transferring objects in noisy and crowded outdoor environments.
